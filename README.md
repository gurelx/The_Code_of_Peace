# Indie Game Project: The Code of Peace

The project has started as a 2D platformer and an indie/pixel art game. I have used the Unreal Engine v4.25.4. Blueprint system to program the mechanics.

## Specifications

### Assets

* The assets are created with Aseprite. Each frame has been hand painted and animated.There are currently over 64 frames for the main character. You can access the uasset files.

* Also, enemy AI system also coded into the system. New enemies will appear as soon as their animation work finishes:)

Background

The game is currently far from complete, yet it serves its purpose, educating me! One day, you may come across this project on known platforms, like Steam :)

## Acknowledgments

While designing the game, the tutorials on YouTube has been truly helpful to me. 

* I have benefitted remarkably about the basics of 2D game development in UE4 from [EvilDoUsHarm](https://www.youtube.com/user/EvilDoUsHarm) 
* For designing and animating in pixels, [AdamCYounis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC08QfQDLAd9D7aYPFgBUIng) inspired me.
